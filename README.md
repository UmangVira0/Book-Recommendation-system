# Book-Recommendation-system
A book recommendation system is a type of recommendation system where we have to recommend similar books to the reader based on his interest.
Here we have obtained data set from kaggle, and collaborative based filtering method is used to built a book recommending system.
There are three datasets, Books( Contain all the information related to books like an author, title, publication year, etc.), Users( Contains registered userâ€™s information like user id, location.), Ratings( Ratings contain information like which user has given how much rating to which book.).
